It  also  has  an \r\nimportant  role  in  improving  the  security  of  ATM  maintenance \r\nprocedures  and  in  increasing  the  confidence  in  the  results\r\ncomputed by  automatic banknote counting machines.  Moreover, \r\nwith  the  proper  hardware,  it  can  be  an  effective  way  to  detect \r\ncounterfeit  banknotes.  With  these  applications  in  mind,  it  was \r\ndeveloped  a  system  that  can  recognize  multiple  banknotes  in \r\ndifferent perspective views and scales, even when they are part of \r\ncluttered environments in which the lighting conditions may vary \r\nconsiderably. The system is also able to recognize banknotes that \r\nare partially visible, folded, wrinkled or even worn by usage.  To \r\naccomplish  this  task,  the  system  is  based  in  image  processing \r\nalgorithms, such as feature detection, description and matching. \r\nTo improve the confidence in the recognition results, the contour \r\nof the banknotes is computed using a homography, and its shape \r\nis analyzed to make sure that it belongs to a banknote. The system \r\nwas  tested  with  82  test  images,  and  all  Euro  banknotes  were \r\nsuccessfully recognized, even when there were several  banknotes \r\nin the same test image, and they were partially occluded.\r\n\r\n## Results\r\n\r\n![Fig. 1 - Detection of a banknote in an ideal perspective view](https://raw.github.com/carlosmccosta/Currency-Recognition/master/Results/Representative%20results/5__(5).jpg___SIFT-Detector_SIFT-Extractor_BF-Matcher_lowQualityImageDB_globalMatch__inliersMatches__0.jpg)\r\n\r\nFig. 1 - Detection of a banknote in an ideal perspective view\r\n\r\n\r\n![Fig. 2 - Detection of a banknote with perspective distortion](https://raw.github.com/carlosmccosta/Currency-Recognition/master/Results/Representative%20results/5__(6).jpg___SURF-Detector_SURF-Extractor_BF-Matcher_lowQualityImageDB_globalMatch__inliersMatches__0.jpg)\r\n\r\nFig. 2 - Detection of a banknote with perspective distortion\r\n\r\n\r\n![Fig. 3 - Detection of a banknote in cluttered environments](https://raw.github.com/carlosmccosta/Currency-Recognition/master/Results/Representative%20results/10__(9).jpeg___SIFT-Detector_SIFT-Extractor_BF-Matcher_lowQualityImageDB_globalMatch__inliersMatches__0.jpg)\r\n\r\nFig. 3 - Detection of a banknote in cluttered environments\r\n\r\n\r\n![Fig. 4 - Detection of partially occluded banknotes](https://raw.github.com/carlosmccosta/Currency-Recognition/master/Results/Representative%20results/500.jpg___GFTT-Detector_SIFT-Extractor_BF-Matcher_dynamicQualityImageDB_globalMatch__inliersMatches__0.jpg)\r\n![Fig. 4 - Detection of partially occluded banknotes](https://raw.github.com/carlosmccosta/Currency-Recognition/master/Results/Representative%20results/50__(13).jpg___SIFT-Detector_SIFT-Extractor_BF-Matcher_mediumQualityImageDB_globalMatch__inliersMatches__0.jpg)\r\n\r\nFig. 4 - Detection of partially occluded banknotes\r\n\r\n\r\n![Fig. 5 - Detection of overlapping banknotes](https://raw.github.com/carlosmccosta/Currency-Recognition/master/Results/Representative%20results/10-20-50.jpg___SIFT-Detector_SIFT-Extractor_BF-Matcher_dynamicQualityImageDB_globalMatch__inliersMatches__1.jpg)\r\n![Fig. 5 - Detection of overlapping banknotes](https://raw.github.com/carlosmccosta/Currency-Recognition/master/Results/Representative%20results/10-20-50.jpg___SIFT-Detector_SIFT-Extractor_BF-Matcher_dynamicQualityImageDB_globalMatch__inliersMatches__2.jpg)\r\n![Fig. 5 - Detection of overlapping banknotes](https://raw.github.com/carlosmccosta/Currency-Recognition/master/Results/Representative%20results/10-20-50.jpg___SIFT-Detector_SIFT-Extractor_BF-Matcher_dynamicQualityImageDB_globalMatch__inliersMatches__0.jpg)\r\n\r\nFig. 5 - Detection of overlapping banknotes\r\n\r\n\r\n## Releases\r\n***\r\n[Windows 8.1 release](https://github.com/carlosmccosta/Currency-Recognition/releases)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Building and developing\r\n***\r\nThe setup instructions on how to build and develop in Visual Studio is available [here](https://github.com/carlosmccosta/Currency-Recognition/blob/master/CurrencyRecognition/docs/Visual%20Studio%20configuration%20for%20OpenCV%202.4.8.txt)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
