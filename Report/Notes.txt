Implementation
	Preprocessing
		Bilateral filter
		CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)
		Gamma correction
	Reference image database setup
		All euro notes (back and front) are recognized, including the new series (5 euro notes)
	Recognition
		Keypoint detection
			SIFT, SURF, GFTT, FAST, ORB, BRISK, STAR, MSER
		Descriptor extraction
			SIFT, SURF, FREAK, BRIEF, ORB, BRISK
		Descriptor matching
			Brute Force, FLANN
		Inliers filtering
			Ration test
			Homography computed with RANSAC
		Results analysis
			Remove results with small area
			Remove results with unacceptable contour shape
				Circularity out of accpetable range
				Aspect ratio out of accpetable range
				Not convex

Results
	100% correct detection in 82 test images
	Test images includes banknotes that are partially occluded, in different positions, scales, orientations, views and with different lighting conditions
	Implementation supports detection of multiple banknotes in the same image

Discussion
	Best results achieved with SIFT and SURF (as keypoint detector and descriptor extrator) in conjunction with a Brute Force descriptor matcher
	Inlier filtering garantees high accuracy in recognizing banknotes (even when partially occluded)

Future work
	Addition of speech synthesis to allow blind people to use the implementation

Conclusion
	Relevance of implementation
	Contributions made to state of art
	Pratical applications
